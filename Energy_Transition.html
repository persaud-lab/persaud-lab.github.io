<rh2>Project Motivation</rh2><br>
The global energy transition is accelerating the demand for stable, long-term underground storage facilities. Projects like the <a href="https://aces-delta.com/">Advanced Clean Energy Storage (ACES)</a> will enable the stockpiling of excess energy resources, effectively balancing the supply and demand of renewable energy. Typical underground storage options include depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers, and salt caverns. Among these, salt caverns are often the most efficient due to their superior pumping cycles, lower operating costs, and high supply volumes (Omojola & Persaud, 2024; Liu et al., 2025). Their low permeability which enhances sealing potential, coupled with high recovery factors, make them ideal candidates for underground energy storage (Hou et al., 2024). While currently used primarily for hydrocarbons and liquified natural gas (LNG), these caverns are slated for future applications in compressed air energy storage and hydrogen as cleaner energy sources evolve.<br><br><br>

<rh2>Challenges in Salt Cavern Storage</rh2><br>
While salt caverns are generally physically stable and "self-healing", impurities within the salt can jeopardize operations, increasing the risk of pipeline corrosion, casing failures, and cavern collapse. Geophysical characterization is therefore essential to evaluate storage integrity, both during the initial site selection and throughout continuous operations. In <a href=" https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GC011573">Omojola & Persaud (2024)</a>, we present a case study from southern Louisiana where geophysical monitoring combined with machine learning based methods helped identify infrastructure hazards impacting active storage operations.<br><br>
	  
<rh2>Geophysical monitoring at the Sorrento Salt Dome</rh2><br>
The Sorrento salt dome located 70 km northwest of New Orleans, Louisiana (Figure 1), has an underground storage capacity of 8.92 bcf and has been used for hydrocarbon storage for over 30 years. Following reports of ground-shaking incidents in 2020, an array of nodal seismometers was deployed to monitor the site. To overcome high levels of industrial background noise that impeded signal identification, we developed a machine learning model to detect microearthquakes and built an earthquake catalog for the study area that covers a 1-year timeframe.<br><br>

Our microearthquake locations were clustered along shear zones of weakness within the salt. We identified two shear zones (Figure 2) that were linked to repetitive well incidents including a mechanical integrity test failure that occurred in 2021. Using time-lapse sonar surveys, we tracked upward salt migration that was causing cavern deformation and highlighted stable portions of the salt for future cavern development.<br>
	  
This study demonstrates how geophysical characterization can identify seismic hazards at mature storage sites. It addresses important operational metrics, including cavern stability, leakage risk, and leachable capacity, providing a blueprint for safer energy storage in a carbon-neutral future.
