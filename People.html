<p>Dr. <strong> Patricia Persaud </strong>joined the Geosciences department at the UA as an Associate Professor in January 2023. She completed her PhD in Geophysics at California Institute of Technology. There her research focused on unraveling crustal deformation beneath the Gulf of California rift using both onshore and offshore recordings of earthquakes and explosions, as well as geodynamic models. She was a Postdoctoral Science Fellow at Columbia University, NY, where she worked with colleagues in Astronomy, Ecology and Climate Change to develop a new multidisciplinary course, Frontiers of Science, which has now become a standard part of Columbia University’s core curriculum.</p> 
<p>
Her recent research has been developing detailed 3-D velocity models for the Salton Trough, southern California, the anticipated epicenter of the next “Big One,” a magnitude 7.8 earthquake on the San Andreas Fault. The models and the identification of buried unmapped faults will help improve earthquake hazard assessments for the region. Patricia and collaborators have also deploy 30 broadband seismometers in Myanamar as part of the Bangladesh-India-Myanmar Array (BIMA) project to determine the crustal structure of the northward continuation of the Sumatra-Andaman subduction zone as it comes onshore beneath the densely populated Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta. Patricia welcomes the opportunity to talk to prospective students and postdocs.</p>

<p><strong><a id="ashlyn"> Alex Goseyun (right)</a></strong> is currently an undergraduate student at the University of Arizona. He obtained his Associates of Science degree in spring 2023 from Northland Pioneer College in Show Low, northeastern Arizona and participated in the inaugural Clouds to the Core program at UA in summer 2023. He investigated whether changing climate with more rainfall has the potential to increase the number of microearthquakes by developing a series of Matlab codes to visualize and compare measured rainfall and microearthquake catalogs. The results can be used to evaluate a mechanism for producing the microearthquakes. He continues to do research with Drs. Persaud and Juárez-Zúñiga and is currently building a high-resolution digital database of data from drilled wells in the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The database will help to determine if variations observed in recent seismic velocity profiles are due to changes in the aquifer systems. This research has important implications for groundwater management in the region. Outside of research and coding, Alex enjoys music and sports.</p><br>
